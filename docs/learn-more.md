## What is CirculateJS?

CirculateJS is a framework built on top of Hapi and Vue to help craft API's to your hearts desire.

It's a "some batteries batteries included" framework for building API's, meaning that it makes some assumptions of what your creating
(for instance, creating an Admin, creating users in a database, etc.), but leave the configuration and layout up to you. 
This gives you the power the craft the API's you want, but still make it your own.

## Why was it created?

When creating things for clients, there is a TON of choices on the market, some free, some not. 
I found that when I was creating something for a client, I was duplicting a lot of things between projects,
mostly because thos projects each had different requirements.

I wanted to create something that had the basics already created (an Admin interface, database, users and roles),
but one that I could add what I wanted, without anything that I wouldn't need. This CirculateJS was born.

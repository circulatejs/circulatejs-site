# Getting Started

## Installing

To install CirculateJS, you only need to run one command, depending on which package manager you use:


```sh
yarn create circulatejs-app <project-directory>

# Or 

npx create-circulatejs-app <project-directory>
```

## Setting Up The Project

After the installer runs, it will ask you a series of questions to setup the project. 
Once this is complete, it will install all the dependancies for the project. 
You will then be able to start your project with the following command, depending on your package manager of choice:

```sh
yarn start

# Or 

npm start
```

If you would like to develop anything for the project, and don't want to have to restart the application every single time
(watch for changes), then your can start the project with the following command, based on your package manager of choice:

```sh
yarn dev

# Or 

npm dev
```

## More To Come

There will be more documentation to come, stay tuned...
